# Using the Mobile Interface

The Kobe Scraper UI is fully optimized for mobile devices, allowing you to manage and monitor your web scraping tasks on the go. This guide will walk you through the mobile-specific features and navigation.

## Getting Started

When you access the application on a mobile device, you'll automatically be directed to the mobile-optimized interface. No additional downloads or configurations are required.

## Navigation

### Bottom Navigation Bar

The primary navigation method on mobile is through the bottom navigation bar, which provides quick access to key sections:

- **Scheduler**: Manage your scheduled scraping jobs
- **Workflow**: Create and edit data processing workflows
- **Results**: View and analyze your scraping results
- **Settings**: Configure application settings

### Swipe Gestures

The application supports several swipe gestures to enhance navigation:

- **Swipe left/right** on job items to reveal quick action buttons
- **Pull down** on any list to refresh the data
- **Swipe back** from the left edge to return to the previous screen

## Mobile Scheduler Interface

The Mobile Scheduler Interface is optimized for smaller screens while maintaining all functionality of the desktop version.

### Viewing Jobs

Jobs are displayed in a scrollable list, with each job card showing:

- Job name and description
- Schedule information
- Current status (active, paused, etc.)
- Action buttons

The list uses virtualization for smooth scrolling even with hundreds of jobs.

### Creating and Editing Jobs

To create a new job:

1. Tap the **New Job** button at the top of the scheduler screen
2. Fill in the job details form:
   - Name and description
   - Select a workflow
   - Set the schedule type (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Configure schedule details
3. Tap **Save** to create the job

To edit an existing job:

1. Tap on the job card or the **Edit** button
2. Make your changes in the form
3. Tap **Save** to update the job

### Job Actions

Each job has quick actions available:

- **Run Now**: Immediately execute the job
- **Pause/Resume**: Toggle the job's active status
- **Delete**: Remove the job
- **View History**: See past runs and results

## Mobile Workflow Builder

The workflow builder offers two viewing modes optimized for mobile:

### List View

The default mobile view shows your workflow nodes in a scrollable list:

- Each node displays its type, name, and basic configuration
- Tap a node to edit its properties
- Use the node palette at the top to add new nodes

### Canvas View

For a visual representation of your workflow:

1. Tap the **Canvas View** button at the top right
2. Pinch to zoom in/out of the workflow diagram
3. Drag nodes to position them
4. Tap on connections to edit or delete them
5. Tap on nodes to view or edit their properties

To switch back to the list view, tap the **List View** button.

## Offline Capabilities

The mobile interface includes robust offline support:

### Working Offline

When your device loses internet connection:

1. An offline indicator appears at the bottom of the screen
2. You can continue viewing and editing your jobs and workflows
3. All changes are stored locally on your device

### Synchronization

When your connection is restored:

1. A notification appears indicating you're back online
2. All changes made while offline are automatically synchronized
3. Any conflicts are presented for your resolution

## Performance Optimizations

The mobile interface includes several optimizations for better performance:

### Data Loading

- Skeleton loaders display while content is loading
- Important data is prefetched in the background
- Lists use virtualization to handle large datasets efficiently

### Resource Usage

- Images and assets are optimized for mobile devices
- Code splitting reduces initial load times
- Animations are conditionally enabled based on device capabilities
