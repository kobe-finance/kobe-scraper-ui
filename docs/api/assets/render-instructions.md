# Instructions for Rendering the API Architecture Diagram

To render the API architecture diagram, follow these steps:

1. **Using Mermaid Live Editor**:
   - Visit [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/)
   - Copy the contents of `api-architecture.md` and paste it into the editor
   - Click on "Download SVG" to export the diagram as an SVG file
   - Save the file as `api-architecture.svg` in this directory

2. **Using VS Code with Mermaid Extension**:
   - Install the "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" extension in VS Code
   - Open `api-architecture.md`
   - Right-click in the editor and select "Open Preview"
   - Right-click on the diagram and select "Save as Image"
   - Save the file as `api-architecture.png` in this directory

3. **Using GitHub**:
   - GitHub natively renders Mermaid diagrams in markdown files
   - You can simply view the diagram by opening `api-architecture.md` on GitHub
   - Use browser extensions or screenshot tools to save the image if needed

Once you have the image file, update the reference in `../architecture.md` to point to the correct file.
